# Simple personal webpage with Flask

This is a simple project for creating a personal information page using:
* Python
* Flask
* docker
* google developer console
* google sheet

The content to write inside the card section inside the webpage are taken from a google sheet file :-)  

For this reason you need to setup a project in google cloud and use the API for managing google drive and google sheets.  

In the final phase you will build and create a docker image that will be used on your GCP in order to make your page available on internet (if you want...) otherwise you could use another type of service or method to make your personal page reacheble.
